# Mate Portfolio

This is site is built with the [gatsby-starter-mate](https://github.com/EmaSuriano/gatsby-starter-mate). Credit to [EmaSuriano](https://github.com/EmaSuriano) for his work.

## Theming üé®

This starters come with a hand-made color palette made by myself, but I highly encourage you to go and customize the colors to match your preference! The colors can be found inside [`theme.ts`](./src/theme.ts), which are going to be loaded by `ThemeProvider` of `styled-components` and apply across all the components inside the application.

```javascript
// colors.js
module.exports = {
  background: '#FFFFFF',
  backgroundDark: '#f0e6f6',

  text: '#333333',

  primary: '#7c37ad',
  primaryLight: '#ae66df',
  primaryDark: '#4b007d',

  secondary: '#ff4081',
  secondaryLight: '#ff79b0',
  secondaryDark: '#c60055',
};
```

Some examples I made by using palettes from [Color Hunt](https://colorhunt.co/):

## Tracking with Google Analytics (Optional) üìà

This starter has the analytics plugin inside the `gatsby-config`, so the only need to do in order to enable it is to provide the `Tracking Id` for your site (starts with `UA-`). Just set a new variable inside your `.env` file called `ANALYTICS_ID` and analytics will be turn on automatically üòÑ

## Setup üí°

```bash
# Install in case there is any new dependency added to the starter
$ yarn

# Build the project to see if everything is working as expected
$ yarn build
```
